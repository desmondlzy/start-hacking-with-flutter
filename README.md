# Start Hacking with Flutter
My notes on how to get started on flutter

## Before Write Any Codes...

- Make sure you have your [dev toolchain](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) ready.
- Flutter uses Dart, so take a quick [tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour) of it right now (I would call Dart a smarter and cleaner version of Java, so it's fairly easy to learn)

## Golden Rule

Whenever you are not sure how to implement something, Google it.

## Read List

In general, the [official website](https://flutter.dev/) gives a lot of useful information, tips, and best practices...

Finishing these items, you will be able to write any UI by yourself (theoretically).

- [Write your first app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- In flutter, almost everything is a widget, so be sure to [understand the use of widgets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets-intro)
- Then we can put the widgets together into the UI we want with [layouts](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/layout) (This can take 70% of your time building any UI)
- We need to navigate in our app from page to page with [routing mechanics](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation/named-routes), sometimes with [arguments](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/navigation/navigate-with-arguments) passing around.

After you read through the above, I think it's a good time to start writing some real code. Just remember the Golden Rule and try to make use of what you learned and build your app.

But Flutter really have a large number of widgets coming with the SDK that help you do a lot of things. So you may want to get familiar with (some of) them if you don't want to reinvent the wheel.

- [Widget of the week](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_sQ9bMltGU&list=PLjxrf2q8roU23XGwz3Km7sQZFTdB996iG), my fav!.
- Read the rest part of the [cookbook](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook) as per your need.
- [Sliver](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/advanced/slivers) is a very important concept and it is almost inevitable you will use it, but it can be also a bit hard to understand.
